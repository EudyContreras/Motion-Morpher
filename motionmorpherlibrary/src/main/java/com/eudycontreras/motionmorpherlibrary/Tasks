Staggering:
    1. Group element by level with adjustable margin
        Elements grouped horizontally should stagger at the same time if they overlap eachother.

    2. Staggering direction is buggy
        When animating a directional stagger the growth direction should be taken under consideration
        in order to animate the items in the right direction

    3. Allow the user to specified if the elements all share a same layout.
        If the elements all share a same layout the morphing animation doe not need to rebuild
