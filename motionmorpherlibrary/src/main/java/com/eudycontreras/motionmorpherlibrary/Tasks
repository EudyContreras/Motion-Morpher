Staggering:
    1. Group element by level with adjustable margin
        Elements grouped horizontally should stagger at the same time if they overlap eachother.

    2. Staggering direction is buggy
        When animating a directional stagger the growth direction should be taken under consideration
        in order to animate the items in the right direction

    3. Allow the user to specified if the elements all share a same layout.
        If the elements all share a same layout the morphing animation doe not need to rebuild

Other:
    - Animates the stagger for rows. If various elements are stack horisontally
    and a vertical stagger is used, stagger the elements at the same row with a
    specified elipson at the same time.

    - Adjust the system so that all stored views are weak references in order to
    avoid memory leaks. Make the program more aware of the view lifecycle.

    - When animating stagger with dynamically computated direction allow the
    stagger to consider the growth direction as well for more accurate stagger directions
    for elements that are insider containers that are both changing dimensions and
    coordinates.

    - Add animate text to the choreographer and check that stagger works for
    list of views.

    - Add meaningful exceptions to the choreographer
