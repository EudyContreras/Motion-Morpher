TODO

- Animates the stagger for rows. If various elements are stack horisontally
and a vertical stagger is used, stagger the elements at the same row with a
specified elipson at the same time.

- Adjust the system so that all stored views are weak references in order to
avoid memory leaks. Make the program more aware of the view lifecycle.

- When animating stagger with dynamically computated direction allow the
stagger to consider the growth direction as well for more accurate stagger directions
for elements that are insider containers that are both changing dimensions and
coordinates.

- Add animate text to the choreographer and check that stagger works for
list of views.
